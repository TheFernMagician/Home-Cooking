## About the Collection

This site houses a collection of photographs of Bridget and Nick's home-cooked meals and dishes. The collection consists of 20 photographs as described by me. Through the use of the navigation bar, object cards, and search bar, the objects in this collection can be filtered by Date, by Subject, and by Description. The collection serves as a way for my partner and I to explore meal options in order to avoid spending money on eating out.
